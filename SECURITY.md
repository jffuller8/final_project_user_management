# Security Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the security issues that were identified and fixed in the User Management System.

## 1. Duplicate Login Route Handler

**Issue:** Two identical login route handlers were defined in user_routes.py, causing potential confusion and unpredictable behavior.

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate route handler, keeping only one version of the login endpoint.

**Impact:** Improved code maintainability and eliminated potential routing conflicts.

## 2. Account Lockout with No Recovery

**Issue:** User accounts that were locked due to failed login attempts had no automatic recovery mechanism.

**Fix:** 
- Added a `locked_at` timestamp field to the User model
- Modified the `is_account_locked` method to check if enough time has passed (1 hour)
- Implemented automatic unlocking after the timeout period
- Added account unlock functionality via email token

**Impact:** Enhanced security by preventing brute force attacks while ensuring legitimate users can regain access to their accounts without admin intervention.

## 3. Permanent Email Verification Tokens

**Issue:** Email verification tokens had no expiration mechanism, creating a permanent security vulnerability.

**Fix:**
- Added a `verification_token_created_at` timestamp field to User model
- Modified the verify_email_with_token method to check token age (48 hours)
- Added an endpoint to request a new verification email

**Impact:** Improved security by limiting the window of vulnerability if verification emails are compromised.

## 4. Weak Password Policy

**Issue:** The system allowed weak passwords with no validation.

**Fix:**
- Added a password strength validation function that checks for:
  - Minimum length (8+ characters)
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Implemented validation during registration and password changes

**Impact:** Significantly improved account security by enforcing stronger passwords that resist brute force and dictionary attacks.

## 5. No Rate Limiting for Authentication

**Issue:** The system lacked rate limiting for authentication endpoints, allowing rapid brute force attempts from the same IP address.

**Fix:**
- Implemented IP-based rate limiting for login, register, and verify-email endpoints
- Added exponential backoff after consecutive failed attempts
- Added request throttling to prevent abuse

**Impact:** Enhanced protection against automated attacks and brute force attempts.

## Testing

All security fixes have been thoroughly tested with dedicated standalone tests that verify the correct implementation and behavior of each fix. The test suite includes:

- Tests for password strength validation
- Tests for account lockout and automatic unlocking
- Tests for email verification token expiration

These tests ensure that the security fixes work as intended and will continue to work correctly as the codebase evolves.

## Additional Security Considerations for User Profile Management

The new User Profile Management feature has been implemented with the following security considerations:

1. **Input Validation**: All profile fields are validated using Pydantic schemas to prevent malicious data.
2. **Authorization Controls**: Users can only view and edit their own profiles, unless they have admin privileges.
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only administrators can change a user's professional status.
4. **Audit Trail**: Professional status changes are timestamped for accountability.
5. **Data Minimization**: APIs only return and accept necessary profile data.
